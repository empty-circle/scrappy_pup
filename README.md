Scrappy Pup is a web scraper for cybersecurity professionals. It looks for signs of malware infections, data leaks, etc.
As of v 1.0 it is RUDIMENTARY. It ain't all that pretty, but it does the task. New features will be added as my ability with python grows. As always, the author of this software isn't liable for anything malicious or stupid that you do while using it. Follow ethics and the law.
